Chat for 2 users to communicate via Rest server requests.
The work has been done with sending the client's Post request and the server's Get requests. The bootstrap framework is enabled.
To connect the chat, you will need an IP address, you can get it by writing the command "ip addr show" in the console / terminal.
In the Program.cs and MessageClientProgram.cs files, we change the IP to our own
